## 🛠 Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Prasanna-Nadrajan/AI-Powered-Code-Review-for-ML-Pipelines.git
   cd AI-Powered-Code-Review-for-ML-Pipelines.git


2. **Create a virtual environment**:

## 🚀 Usage

1. **Run a review** on your ML project folder:

   ```bash
   ai-review --path /path/to/your/ml/project --output report.md
   ```
2. **View the report**:

   ```bash
   open report.md
   ```
3. **Customize rules** by editing `config/rules.yaml`.

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

* **`config/rules.yaml`**: Defines which checks are active and their severity levels.
* **`config/plugins/`**: Drop custom Python modules to extend review capabilities.
* **CLI Options**:

  * `--path`: Path to the target project.
  * `--output`: File path for the generated report.
  * `--format`: Report format (`md`, `html`, `json`).

## 🏗️ Architecture

1. **Parser Layer**: Builds an AST of your code and ML pipeline definitions.
2. **Rule Engine**: Applies a suite of linting and profiling rules.
3. **Report Generator**: Compiles findings into user-friendly formats.
4. **Plugin Loader**: Dynamically loads custom rule sets.
